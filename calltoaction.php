<h3 class="text--center text--grey">A Call to Action by the Beyond Viral Suppression Initiative</h3>
<h1 class="text--center text--red">Improving Outcomes for People Living with HIV</h1>
<hr>
<p>This is a <strong>call to action</strong> for governments, international organisations, and the wider health community to align on a new HIV policy agenda that addresses the crucial unmet needs people living with HIV (PLHIV) – to ensure that PLHIV can live longer in good health, and participate fully in society and the economy.</p>
<p>Current HIV policy frameworks often focus on the key objective of achieving and maintaining viral suppression, but do not go beyond this to address other crucial health and social dimensions of HIV. In a Europe where viral suppression should increasingly be the norm for PLHIV, it is vital that policy makers and health care providers also turn their attention to wider HIV related challenges.</p>
<p>In particular, action is needed to address the increased risk of co-morbidities (co-existing medical problems) among PLHIV – including mental health issues. In addition, ensuring full social inclusion of PLHIV continues to be a crucial challenge. Policy makers must address the continuing problem of stigma and discrimination – for example by ensuring that PLHIV are able to secure and retain employment.</p>
<p>As a first step, we call on the EU and Member States to:
<ol>
    <li>Update the <strong>Dublin Declaration</strong> on Partnership to Fight HIV/AIDS<sup><a href="#footnote_1">1</a></sup>, adopting a ‘life-long’ approach to the health and social inclusion of PLHIV</li>
    <li>Adopt as soon as possible an <strong>integrated EU Policy Framework</strong> on HIV/AIDS, viral hepatitis and TB - thereby extending the focus of the EU Action Plan on HIV/AIDS, which comes to an end in 2016</li>
    <li>Align on <strong>international policy indicators</strong> necessary to monitor and assess country performance in improving health and social outcomes for PLHIV</li>
</ol></p>
<p>PLHIV should be able to live a life that is comparable not only in length, but also in quality, to the rest of our populations. This aspiration should motivate the HIV response in all European countries – not only those that already perform well in relation to the UNAIDS targets for diagnosis, treatment and viral suppression.</p>
<h4 class="text--red">Background</h4>
<p>Whilst important progress has been made in the global response to HIV/AIDS, with the European Union playing an instrumental role, the European region – and in particular Eastern Europe – now has the fastest growing HIV epidemic globally. 29,992 people were diagnosed with HIV in the EU/EEA in 2014. At the same time, PLHIV are living longer, which has created new challenges relating to the prevention, treatment, and management of co-morbidities.</p>
<p>With the EU Action Plan on HIV/AIDS expiring at the end of 2016, and the Dublin Declaration on Partnership to fight HIV/AIDS now more than a decade old, European governments and the EU institutions have an opportunity to renew their political commitment to fighting both the transmission of HIV, as well as its health and social impacts.</p>
<p>Continuing challenges include the strengthening of prevention programmes, reducing late diagnoses, ensuring equity and universality of access, and the social consequences of HIV that stem from stigma and discrimination.</p>
<p>In addition, governments and health systems must respond to the emerging challenges relating to PLHIV living longer at increased risk of co-morbidity. We must ensure that PLHIV remain in good health as they grow older, and can lead successful, productive and rewarding lives.</p>
<h4 class="text--red">The Beyond Viral Suppression Initiative</h4>
<p>The Beyond Viral Suppression initiative arises out of a shared recognition among leading HIV experts that there are crucially important issues relating to the health and social inclusion of PLHIV that have to date received insufficient attention from policy makers and health care providers, and which must now form part of our HIV response.</p>
<p>In an era when ageing populations and health system sustainability are central challenges for all European countries, the initiative will also aim to inform debates about cost-effective strategies for co-morbidity prevention and management, whilst ensuring patient-centred health care delivery. Our recommendations should therefore be of high relevance both to policy makers and the wider health community.</p>
<p>The steering group is co-chaired by: <strong>Nikos Dedes</strong>, the Founder of Positive Voice (the Greek association for PLHIV) and a Board member of the European AIDS Treatment Group (EATG); Professor <strong>Jane Anderson</strong> of Homerton University Hospital NHS Foundation Trust in London; and Professor <strong>Jeffrey Lazarus</strong> of ISGlobal, Hospital Clinic at the University of Barcelona, and CHIP, Rigshospitalet, University of Copenhagen. The initiative is enabled by sponsorship provided by Gilead Sciences and ViiV Healthcare.</p>
<p>Jeffrey Lazarus is coordinating a study group of leading academics<sup><a href="footnote_2">2</a></sup> to develop a performance assessment of HIV services ‘beyond viral suppression’ – focusing on: i. access to appropriate health services; ii. health outcomes –comorbidity and coinfection prevention, and health-related quality of life; and iii. social outcomes.</p>
<p>The study group will seek to identify the policy indicators necessary to assess countries’ performance at improving health and social outcomes ‘beyond viral suppression’. Our aim is thereby to complement the work of other initiatives focusing on HIV prevention, diagnosis, and access to high quality treatment and care.</p>
