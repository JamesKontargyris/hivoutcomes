<h3 class="text--center text--grey">A Call to Action by the Beyond Viral Suppression Initiative</h3>
<h1 class="text--center text--red">Improving Outcomes for People Living with HIV</h1>
<hr>
<p>This is a <strong>call to action</strong> for governments, international organisations, and the wider health community to align on a new HIV policy agenda that addresses the crucial unmet needs people living with HIV (PLHIV) – to ensure that PLHIV can live longer in good health, and participate fully in society and the economy.</p>
<p>Current HIV policy frameworks often focus on the key objective of achieving and maintaining viral suppression, but do not go beyond this to address other crucial health and social dimensions of HIV. In a Europe where viral suppression should increasingly be the norm for PLHIV, it is vital that policy makers and health care providers also turn their attention to wider HIV related challenges.</p>
<p>In particular, action is needed to address the increased risk of co-morbidities (co-existing medical problems) among PLHIV – including mental health issues. In addition, ensuring full social inclusion of PLHIV continues to be a crucial challenge. Policy makers must address the continuing problem of stigma and discrimination – for example by ensuring that PLHIV are able to secure and retain employment.</p>
<p>As a first step, we call on the EU and Member States to:
<ol>
    <li>Update the Dublin Declaration on Partnership to Fight HIV/AIDS1, adopting a ‘life-long’ approach to the health and social inclusion of PLHIV</li>
    <li>Adopt as soon as possible an integrated EU Policy Framework on HIV/AIDS, viral hepatitis and TB - thereby extending the focus of the EU Action Plan on HIV/AIDS, which comes to an end in 2016</li>
    <li>Align on international policy indicators necessary to monitor and assess country performance in improving health and social outcomes for PLHIV</li>
</ol></p>
